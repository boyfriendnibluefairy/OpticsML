## OpticsML

🚨 Do not fork this repository yet because it is still under construction.

💻 OpticsML is a desktop application for performing lens or diffractive optical element (DOE) design using machine learning.

### Packages[^1]:
|   | Package | Description |
|---|----------------------|----------|
|🥳 |ch01_examples |includes all runnable scripts for all the functionalities of OpticsML. Detailed tutorials will be added in this README.md soon.|
|🔭|ch02_ray_tracing |contains all codes related to geometric ray tracing, lens or DOE instantiation, and optical properties.|
|💡|ch03_wave_propagation |comprise of all related to scalar wave propagation methods like angular spectrum method (ASM) and its variants.|
|🛠️|ch04_utilities |incorporates all modules related to image processing, file handling, etc.|
|🖼️|ch05_visualisation  |encloses all codes related to plotting, intensity and phase distribution, spot diagram, etc.|
|📅|ch06_GUI  | contains multimedia for OpticsML framework and pyqt codes for user interface|
|🤖|ch07_machine_learning  |includes all codes related to pytorch and other wrapper modules
|

[^1]: Packages are supposed to be named 01_examples but python does not import modules with filenames starting with digits. So I prefixed it with "ch01" to denote "chapter 01", "ch02" for "chapter 02" and so on . . .
